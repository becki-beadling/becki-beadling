### I am an Assistant Professor at Temple University (Go Owls!) in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. I use observations and climate model simulations to understand the oceanâ€™s role in the climate system. Given its role in the carbon and heat budget of our planet, understanding our ocean and how it will evolve will help reduce uncertainty in climate change projections. My research particularly focuses on ocean circulation and physical and biogeochemical processes within the Southern Ocean, their projected changes under continued warming, and the role these remote processes play in the global climate. I also have a strong interest in building process-oriented diagnostics to investigate biases in ocean properties and circulation in coupled climate models. I am a past NOAA Climate and Global Change postdoctoral fellow and maintain strong collaborations with NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory where I contribute to the development of GFDL's eddy paramaterized to eddy permitting coupled model hierachy.
